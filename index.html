          Descripion : This is a single player 2D puzzle/action game that I made
          by myself in two weeks. In the game, you use your shield to avoid
          being hit by cannonballs to try and complete each level. You also must
          use your shield stratigically to deflect cannonballs into buttons.

          Descripion : This is a two player puzzle platformer game that I worked
          on in a group of 5. The main mechanic that the game utilizes is a
          teleport feature, where you can teleport to the other player. This
          mechanic contributes to interesting puzzles and decision making, as
          you must always be aware of your position and your partners position
          in order to successfully teleport.

          Contributions : I was responisble for designing two levels. I was also
          responsible for creating features of the levels, such as the pully
          system, elevators, laser aesthetics, and the spark aesthetic.
